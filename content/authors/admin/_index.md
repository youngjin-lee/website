I am an associate professor of learning analytics at [University of North Texas](https://unt.edu). I got my B.S. and M.S. in Earth Science (focusing on astronomy) from [Seoul National University](http://en.snu.ac.kr), and got my Ph.D. in Educational Computing from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://uiuc.edu).

After getting my Ph.D., I worked at [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu) (NCSA) as a senior research programmer. Before I came to KU, I worked at [Massachusetts of Institute of Technology](https://mit.edu) (MIT) as a research associate. While working at MIT, I participated in various educational data mining research projects that investigated educational benefits of a Web-based physics tutoring environment called MasteringPhysics.

I am interested in applying innovative technologies to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning. I developed prototypes of Web-based and mobile physics learning environments that can improve student learning of Newtonian physics concepts. These days, I am focusing on learning analytics and educational data mining techniques that can accurately estimate the ability of students learning in the computer-based learning environment. I am also interested in using innovative learning technologies to  help students learn [Computational Thinking](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf) skills.
