abstract: With a rapid increase in the number of people who own a handheld device, such as an iPod, education researchers and administrators started looking for a way to use a handheld device to foster student learning. However, the current use of a mobile device in education is quite limited. With few exceptions, it is mostly used as a simple media player that allows learners to watch pre-recorded lectures or view course materials. This article describes an interactive physics tutor running on an iPod Touch and how it could facilitate the learner's understanding of physics concepts by providing appropriate scaffolding based on physics misconception research and e-learning design principles.
