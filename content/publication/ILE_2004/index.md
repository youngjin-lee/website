abstract: "The purpose of this tudy is to investigate whether the use of extensible external representations can improve the efficiency of Web search processes for open-ended questions. An experimental Web search environment capable of visually representing Web search processes was developed, and its utility was evaluated. Thirty undergraduate and graduate students were asked to search for meaningful Web-based information about 'Educational Technology.' All search processes performed by each subject were recorded and analyzed. Findings showed that extensible external representations were able to reduce the cognitive load of organizing and reusing multiple Web search results, improving the overall efficiency of iterative Web search processes."
