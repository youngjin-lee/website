abstract: "The aims of this study are: (1) to develop iPad-based comput- er simulations called iSimPhysics that can help people learn newtonian physics concepts; and (2) to assess its educational benefits and pedagogical usefulness. To facilitate learning, iSimPhysics visualizes abstract physics concepts, and allows for conducting a series of computer simulations implement- ing inquiry cycle and model progression approaches. To pro- mote learners’ motivation, iSimPhysics adopts various game mechanics in its learning tasks. To assess educational ben- efits and usefulness of iSimPhysics, selected questions from Force Concept inventory (FCi) and Pedagogically Meaning- ful Learning Questionnaire (PMLQ) were administered be- fore and after 17 graduate students used iSimPhysics. Paired t-tests indicate that students were able to solve more FCi problems (p < 0.01, ES = 2.28) and to provide more correct explanations (p < 0.01, ES = 1.19) after using iSimPhysics. Students’ responses to PMLQ questions indicate that inquiry- based learning activities using iSimPhysics were helpful for them to learn target newtonian physics concepts. The find- ings of this study may suggest that iPad-based computer sim- ulations providing appropriate instructional scaffolding (e.g., visualization, inquiry cycle and model progression) can be an effective learning tool for physics (and possibly other sci- ence) concepts."
